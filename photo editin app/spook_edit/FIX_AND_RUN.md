### If API features don't work:

- Get it from: https://www.fal.ai/dashboard
- Edit `.env` and replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual key

### If stickers appear as emojis:
- PNG assets haven't been added yet
- See `STICKERS_GUIDE.md` for instructions

The app will still work without an API key! You can:
- ✅ Select photos from gallery

- ✅ Position/scale/rotate stickers
- ✅ Save edited images
- ❌ AI filters won't work (need API key)
