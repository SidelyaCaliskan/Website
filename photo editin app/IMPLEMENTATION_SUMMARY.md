The sticker feature has been fully implemented and is ready to use **WITHOUT requiring an API key**. This feature works completely offline!

### What's Been Implemented:

- Added `STICKERS_README.md` with asset guidelines
- Created 10 sticker categories with 30+ emoji-based placeholder stickers
- Categories include: Ghosts, Pumpkins, Bats, Witches, Monsters, Spiders, Skulls, Candy, Text, and More

#### 2. **Sticker Service** (`lib/services/sticker_service.dart`)
- Loads sticker categories from JSON configuration
- Manages sticker assets
- Supports both emoji and image-based stickers
- Search functionality for finding stickers by name
- Singleton pattern for efficient resource management

#### 3. **Sticker Browser Widget** (`lib/widgets/editor/sticker_browser.dart`)
- Beautiful tabbed interface showing all sticker categories
- Grid view of stickers in each category
- Smooth category switching with animations
- Error handling and loading states
- Themed to match your Halloween aesthetic

#### 4. **Sticker Layer Widget** (`lib/widgets/editor/sticker_layer.dart`)
- **Gesture Controls:**
  - Tap to select sticker
  - Single finger drag to move
  - Two finger pinch to scale (0.3x - 3.0x)
  - Two finger rotation
  - Delete button when selected
- **Visual Feedback:**
  - Selection border (blue outline)
  - Delete button (red circle with X)
  - Real-time transformation preview

#### 5. **Editor Integration** (`lib/views/editor/editor_screen.dart`)
- Sticker browser replaces "coming soon" message
- Sticker canvas overlay on top of image
- Full integration with EditorProvider
- All sticker operations wired up:
  - Add stickers
  - Move stickers
  - Scale stickers
  - Rotate stickers

## üîß Next Steps: Adding Real Sticker Assets

Currently using emoji as placeholders. To add real PNG stickers:

1. Create PNG files with transparency (512x512px recommended)
2. Place them in appropriate category folders:
   ```
   assets/stickers/ghosts/cute_ghost.png
   assets/stickers/pumpkins/jack_o_lantern.png
   assets/stickers/bats/flying_bat.png
   ```
3. Update `assets/data/sticker_categories.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "id": "ghost_1",
     "name": "Cute Ghost",
     "emoji": "üëª",
     "assetPath": "assets/stickers/ghosts/cute_ghost.png"
   }
   ```
4. Run `flutter pub get` to refresh assets
5. Restart the app

## üîë Adding Your API Key

To enable AI-powered features (Filters, Face Effects, Backgrounds), add your Nano Banana API key:

### Step 1: Create `.env` file
Create a file named `.env` in `spook_edit/` folder:

```env
FAL_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

### Step 2: Update `app_constants.dart`
The app already loads from `.env`, just make sure this line exists:

```dart
static String falApiKey = dotenv.env['FAL_API_KEY'] ?? '';
```

### Step 3: Load environment in `main.dart`
Make sure `main.dart` loads the env file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_dotenv/flutter_dotenv.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await dotenv.load(fileName: ".env");
  runApp(const MyApp());
}
```

## üêõ Known Limitations

### Stickers
- Stickers are NOT rendered into the final saved image yet
- They're overlays only visible in the editor
- **To Fix**: Need to implement image composition (combining stickers with base image)

### Image Export with Stickers
The save functionality currently exports only the base image. To include stickers:

1. Use `image` package to create a canvas
2. Draw the base image
3. Draw each sticker with transformations
4. Export the composed image

**Recommendation**: I can implement this image composition feature next if you'd like.

## üí° Suggested Implementation Order

Since you'll be adding the API key soon, here's what I recommend implementing next:

### Priority 1: Image Export with Stickers ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Why**: Users can't save their sticker creations yet
**Effort**: Medium (2-3 hours)
**Benefit**: Makes sticker feature actually useful

### Priority 2: Local Image Filters ‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Why**: Works without API, improves UX
**Effort**: Medium (3-4 hours)
**Benefit**: Instant filter preview, no API costs

### Priority 3: Better Sticker Assets ‚≠ê
**Why**: Emoji placeholders aren't professional
**Effort**: Low (design time)
**Benefit**: Much better visual appeal

## üìû Next Actions

**Want me to implement next:**
1. ‚ú® Image export with stickers rendered (so save actually includes them)
2. üé® Local image filters (brightness, contrast without API)
3. üñºÔ∏è Face effects using AI prompts (when API key is ready)
4. üì∏ Camera capture improvements

**Let me know which feature you'd like me to work on next!**
